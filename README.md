# 🚀 Just Trying Something New – Chat-Verse Sigma 💬

---

## ✨ What is This?

This is a **real-time chatroom web application** where users can:
- Chat in public rooms
- Sign in with Google using NextAuth
- Experience a simple and smooth chat interface (work in progress)

Tech Stack:
- **Next.js** (frontend & backend)
- **NextAuth.js** (Google authentication)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- Deployed on **Vercel**

This project is **still in progress**, mostly a way to explore cool tech together.

## ⚠️ Current Irregularities / Limitations

### 🔍 Room Images Are Temporary  
➡️ **The room image is only stored temporarily in your browser’s memory.**  
➡️ **It will disappear if you reload the page or close the tab.**  
➡️ Images are **not stored in any database yet**.

---

### 🔐 Private Rooms Aren’t Really Shareable (Yet)  
➡️ You can create a **private room using a passkey**, but:  
- It **only works for you**, on your browser session.  
- **Nobody else can access the room**, even if they know the passkey.  
- Private rooms are **not saved anywhere**, and they’ll disappear if you refresh the page.

---

### 🛠️ Other Small Things  
- No notifications or typing indicators yet.
- No UI for managing rooms or seeing active users.

## 🧑‍💻 Why This Exists?

Just having fun experimenting with real-time apps, auth flows, and modern web dev stacks.  
Will evolve slowly over time, one late-night session at a time ☕.
